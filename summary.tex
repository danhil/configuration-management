\section{Week 1}
The number of communication channels increases faster than the number of people involved in a project -->  more time spent coordinating work between people.
The main question that occurs in different forms is: what program is this? This and resulting questions is due to coordination failure. Configuration management is the art of identifying, organizing and controlling modifications to software. Maximize productivity by minimizing mistakes.
A good SCM system strives to be comprised of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Version Management - Enables the secure and controlled storage, retrieval and versioning of all project assets (source code, documentation, test results and so on).
\item Change Management - Enables the capture, tracking and management of all types of project changes (requests for change, enhancements, defects) and direct comparison of these changes to the versions of the projectâ€™s assets used to implement them.
\item Build Management - Enables the consistent and reliable construction (build) of software applications and reports on their contents and results.
\item  Process Management - Enables the reporting of actions, history and milestones and provides the capability to customize or enforce development workflow and procedures.
\end{itemize}

There are three types of main problems in CM: \\
\begin{description}
    \item[Double maintenance]
    is the problem of keeping multiple identical copies of software. Bugfixes must be identical in each copy. Multiple copies inadvertently diverge over time.
    \item[Shared data]
    arises when multiple people are simultaneously accessing and modifying the same data --> interference due to simultaneous changes on the same code.
    \item[Simultaneous update] is the problem that arises when the same software is simultaneously updated, can lead to loss of changes. \ldots
\end{description}

\subsection{Program families}
The purpose of professional software development is to build a program family --> alternative forms of the same program. The CM  strategy must successfully control all of the members of a program family to keep programs identical in the way they are supposed to be and different in the way that they are supposed to be different. Need to record and understand the different program versions and be able to produce the correct version to fill a particular demand. To solve the double maintenance problem a program \textit{library} is built up that contains modules. The list of modules representing a program is called the \textit{configuration}the process of selecting the modules is called \textit{configuring} the program.
The library should reflect the relationships between the modules and create an understanding of the ways in which the versions differ and in which ways they are the same. Two different kinds of versions: \textit{revisions} and \textit{variations}.

\subsubsection{revisions}
A revision is a new version of a module intended to supersede the previous version. Old versions of a program are needed to eg reproduce bugs.

\subsubsection{variations}
Module variations fulfill the same function for slightly different situations, alternative interchangeable parts. Variations coexist as equal alternatives. Stubs used to mask out modules for eg testing purposes.
Storing versions of modules can be done as separate files, can be identified by naming conventions --> double maintenance. Deltas means to store one full version of a file and represent differences as deltas, contains the full description of differences between two files. Drawback is that if the main file is lost or corrupted all versions are lost, hard to represent where the differences are in a file.
Conditional compilation of a source file can be used to mask out the differences, this however can lead to increased complexity of reading and modifying code. Better for storing versions but not revisions.

\subsection{Derivations}
The history/composition of a program is its derivation. Knowing history and derivation helps debugging. Derivations must be precise and show exactly which modules and what revisions of these modules were linked to form a build. A derivation of a program requires identification of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Linker compiler used to build program
    \item data input
    \item options and arguments in build
    \item reason of why the options and arguments were used
    \item person responsible for build
    \item date and time of build
\end{itemize}
Should be kept for source code, object code and executable images etc.
Unique identification of objects under CM is important.

\subsection{Reproducibility}
Reproducibility is needed to be able to reproduce exactly the program that is intended.
Anything that appears in a derivation must be \textit{frozen} implies both immutability and protection against deletion.

\subsection{Baselines and private workspaces}
Important to have stability to develop software successfully. Solution to team coordination problem is to use a project \textit{baseline} in conjunction with individual workspaces for developers.The \textit{baseline} is the shared project database that contains all of the components from which the product is derived, it contains the library of modules and is tightly controlled in respect to code modifications. Each programmer has a private workspace which contains information from the baseline. Simultaneous update problem can be replaced by serial update if checkout-lock-checkin process is used, however normally optimistic concurrency process is used where checkout/checkin does not lock, instead long transactions lead to merges.

\section{Week 2}
Workshops are a good way of introducing SCM  to a company because:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Evolution of company wide processes and plans.
\end{itemize}
Three main concepts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Construction site -- collaborative work -- putting it together \\there is a need to collaborate, coordinate and communicate. Need of parallel work, although for coordination some work may be done in serial. Parallel work --> copy for all --> double maintenance, temporary copy for all that is submitted --> simultaneous maintenance. Change --> need traceability between change request and implementation--> CCB to evaluate. Communication, need good communication bandwidth --> good documentation, comments coding standards. Communicate through artefacts.
    \item The study -- private workspace -- getting work done need good rules of conduct and rules. \\
    Have artefacts in a central repository, need for immutable isolated objects to work on --> no work on central repository. Tools can be chosen individually if no need for reproducibility. A configuration is called partially bound if it can if the exact versions can vary over time. Bound configuration is needed for reproducibility --> can form a baseline --> basis for further development formal change management is needed.
    \item The library -- store, create and register -- collecting, sharing, using knowledge  \\
    Every stable issue of an artefact is a version in versioning tool. Tool should impose structure on how versions develop from each other and keep track of all information about different versions. Version graphs, branching, merging.
    \item Conclusions Keep good contact with management and have their support.
    \item The study -- the personal workspace
    \item The library -- the use and organisation of collective knowledge
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ Different cases of distributed development}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Locally group awareness, right tools, common file system.
    \item Distance working Bringing home files, little awareness of others doings, cm tools can help. Remote login.
    \item Co-located groups Groups working on eg different modules. Files stored in different file systems but same CM system. Important to maintain knowledge of development status between groups. Change management of common components is of importance.
    \item Distributed groups Not only are projects distributed, members are also distributed. Communication, meetings not even between members. Important to support division of files and concurrent development.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Architectures for distributed development}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Remote login needs a good connection to the server everyone works at same site - good.
    \item Local files that are pushed to server CM tool based.
    \item Several sites by master-slave connection The files copied to slave can not be modified anywhere else.
    \item Several sites with areas of responsibility Only the files connected to the responsibility can be modified. More permanent division of permissions lead to automated synchronization.
    \item Several sites with equal servers Several mirrored/synchronized servers. Hard to synchronize and resolve merge conflicts.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Distributed development challenges producer/consumer or shared source code.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Organization Who is responsible for the overall project/managerial issues/system architecture? Who are the team members for the project? -- Super project organizational structure.
    \item Communication Establish system architecture upfront, developers working towards the same goal, what tools are used, software development environment. Minimize dependencies between software component groups and maximize communication bandwidth.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Producer consumer scenario}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define the system architecture and assign components to each collocated team
    \item Assign a common architect whom is responsible for designing the common architecture and making the final decisions.
    \item Assign a project manager who has the responsibility for defining the integration plan and tracking the progress of each project iteration.
    \item There are different branching strategies as: branch per user, per site, per activity etc.
\end{itemize}

\section{ Week 3 - the study metaphor}
\subsection{Defining and building configurations} 
Configuration --> collection of elements that fulfill a specific purpose. Inputs to the process of building a configuration is : source elements, system model, version selection, derived elements -> incremental building.
To build a makefile: parametrized, automate and manage errors. Use directories to hold configuration, eg dev stable main etc. Build a directory tree structure for modules where each one has dev, main etc.
Makes limitations are : lacks version selection support, does not register tools and options used for building.

\subsection{Builds}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development environment Best goal for development environments is reproducibility. Can vary when flexibility is needed but can be invariant when reproducibility is needed.
    \item Distributed and not distributed environments Fully distributed development or build environments ensures consistency in builds and development platform. Undistributed faster but harder to maintain.
    Conforming reproducibility is harder on distributed systems as dependencies are spawned throughout the network. In order to confirm the reliability of a distributed development system we must create a non distributed version of the system.
    \item[Tools] Choosing build or other tools is done with consideration to Licensing, Maintenance, Life expectancy and features. 
    \item Build reproducibility  in assessing reproducibility the three factors of : build, runtime, development and execution environments should be taken into account.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Peter Feiler - CM models}
CM provides stability to the production of a SW system by controlling the product evolution through; Configuration identification, Configuration control, Configuration status accounting and Configuration audit.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Check-out/check-in model
    In the checkout/check-in model, the version support of individual files is the focus. Files are stored individually in a repository from which they are checked out whenever the files are accessed, and checked in when they have changed.
    This repository can store multiple versions of the files but has no notion of logical changes. Supports sequential version history and version branching(independant development path, different versions etc).
    The basic mechanism used to prevent conflicts by simultaneous modifications is that of locking.
    \item Composition model 
    The composition model is an extension on the checkout/check-in model. This model allows developers to think in configurations instead of individual files and supports the handling of a configuration history.
    Although the complete checkout/check-in model is represented in the composition model, it enables the use of different strategies for updating through the use of
    improved support for the management of configurations. A configuration is defined as being built up from a system model and version selection rules.
    The system model determines which files are used, while the version selection rules determine which version of the files (e.g. the latest versions or of a certain development state).Variants are represented by branches
    and identified by branch labels. Limitation:  Variant and logical change information is contained in the naming conventions.
    \item Long transaction model
    The long transactions model takes a broader approach by assuming that a system is built up out of logical atomic changes.A change is performed as a transaction, not visible until commit a commit creates a new version
    of the modified data elements. Consists of a workspace and concurrency control scheme, workspaces are supported by the CM tool and local history etc. Optimistic concurrency scheme allows local workspaces to 
    modify same component, conflicts are recognized on check in.
    Its focus is on the coordination and integration of these changes. Basically, it uses versions of configurations and versions of files.
    A configuration is created based on a change request which is stored separately. Files in this configuration can be synchronized using the check-out/check-in model.
    When the change is completed, the complete configuration is stored back into the repository and integrated with other changes.
    \item Change set model
    The change set model also works based on change requests and has a lot in common with the long transactions model. Represents the set of modifications to different components that make up
    a logical change and thus provides natural link to change requests. However, it starts with a certain configuration as the basis for changes.
    This is then changed according to the independent change requests that come in.
    New configurations of the product are then created by applying sets of the independently stored changes on the baseline version.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Configuration Planning and Management:
    A formal document and plan to guide the CM program that includes items such as:
    Personnel; Responsibilities and Resources; Training requirements; Administrative meeting guidelines, including a definition of procedures and tools;
    baselining processes; Configuration control and Configuration status accounting; Naming conventions; Audits and Reviews; and Subcontractor/Vendor CM requirements. \\
    Planning and management is basically what it says. It is the normal planning to define and
    establish organizational responsibilities, in this case, the CM Teamâ€™s responsibilities abstract
    well as the CM-related responsibilities of others. It includes the resources necessary and
    the facilities that are needed. It ensures appropriate CM tools, processes, and activities are
    available and applied. Continuous improvement is another sub-function under planning
    and management and essential for reaching level two of CMMi. A slight change of
    wording and the responsibilities could apply to the planning and management function of
    any organization or the organization as a whole. The one area that is different or unique is
    the responsibility to ensure data preservation and interoperability (current data). Data
    preservation and interoperability means that all of the configuration items and
    documentation are stored, correct, and available when needed. In other words, a CM
    library is maintained with all the appropriate documents, and those documents are up-to-
    date (baselined) and accurate including requirements, drawings, as builds, effective dates
    (when a change is supposed to be in place and an excellent performance indicator),
    approved changes, change notices and release dates.
    \item Configuration Identification (CI):
    Consists of setting and maintaining baselines, which define the system or subsystem architecture,
    components, and any developments at any point in time. It is the basis by which changes to any part of an information system are identified, documented,
    and later tracked through design, development, testing, and final delivery. CI incrementally establishes and maintains the definitive current basis for Configuration Status Accounting (CSA)
    of a system and its configuration items (CIs) throughout their lifecycle (development, production, deployment, and operational support) until disposal. \\
    This process involves identification of documents comprising the configuration baselines
    for the system and lower-level items (including logistics support elements) and
    identification of those items and documents. When an item is identified, it is known as a
    configuration item (CI). Configuration Identification determines the makeup of any and
    all products along with their associated documentation. It defines performance, interface,
    and other attributes for configuration items; provides unique identity (i.e. drawing,
    document or ID numbers) to products, components, and documentation; specifies
    identification markings (if required); modifies product and document identifiers to reflect
    major changes; maintains release control and baseline definition; provides reference for
    changes and corrective actions; and correlates document revision level to product
    configuration, which enables users to distinguish between product versions, allows
    people to correlate a product to the appropriate instructions, and correlates items to
    service life. What it boils down to is that configuration identification determines how
    document control numbers and version numbering are applied and used so that
    everything is labeled correctly and understandably as prescribed by the Configuration
    Item (CI) manager of that product.
    \item Configuration Control:
    Includes the evaluation of all change requests and change proposals, and their subsequent approval or disapproval.
    It is the process of controlling modifications to the system's design, hardware, firmware, software, and documentation. \\
    Change Control Management during the lifecycle of a product is a shared function of
    both the CI manager and the Change Control Board (CCB) made up of stake holders,
    customers and executives. Change decisions are based on the knowledge of the change
    impact to the product, costs and the customer. This helps limit changes to those that are
    necessary or offer significant benefit to the product, the customer or hopefully both. The
    CCB should evaluate costs (investment analysis), savings, and trade-offs, ensuring that
    everyoneâ€™s interests are considered before approving. CM maintains consistency
    between the products and all relevant documentation (i.e. as built, as planned and as
    released with effectivity dates). The CM process documents and limits all variances in a
    product and provides for continued supportability of the product after a change is
    implemented.
    \item Configuration Status Accounting:
    Includes the process of recording and reporting configuration item descriptions (e.g., hardware, software, firmware, etc.) and all departures
    from the baseline during design and production. In case of suspected problems, the verification of baseline configuration and approved modifications can be quickly determined. \\
    Configuration Status Accounting is just a fancy name for having information on products
    and processes, the key being having the valid and current information available for
    retrieval including any change decisions and change impacts. It provides access to
    complete configuration information on products and processes to answer any inquiries
    concerning design change planning, design problems, maintenance, and operating-life
    expectancy. It is a source for configuration history and accurate identification of each
    product delivered. Just having that information reduces risk, improves the projectâ€™s or
    the customerâ€™s capability to identify, produce, inspect, deliver, operate, maintain, repair,
    and refurbish products all of which are necessary. Without CM, this information might
    or might not be available, and its accuracy would certainly be in question. It can mean
    the difference between the success or failure of a system or product and provide
    management with answers as well as capturing corporate knowledge that departs weekly
    as baby-boomers retire.
    \item Configuration Verification and Audit:
    An independent review of hardware and software for the purpose of assessing compliance with established performance requirements,
    commercial and appropriate military standards, and functional, allocated, and product baselines. Configuration audits verify the system and subsystem configuration documentation
    complies with their functional and physical performance characteristics before acceptance into an architectural baseline. \\
    Verification and audit of physical and functional requirements is often the final project
    management activity for new and modified systems and / or products being implemented.
    Without a formal Quality Assurance (QA) process in an organization, this may be the
    only way to capture failures, compliance and implementation issues (not installed as
    specified in the plan (CM)). Normally, CM and QA together ensure the product design
    provides the agreed-to performance capabilities but in some organizations these activities
    may fall solely under CM, such as validating the integrity of the configuration
    documentation and the consistency between a product and its documentation.
    CM is responsible for establishing the initial
    product baseline based on requirements, customer needs and organizational goals. It also
    ensures that the product has been designed in accordance with the initial requirements as
    modified along the way and as agreed to before being modified. It ensures that the first
    article built is how subsequent systems are built as designed and tested.
\end{itemize}

\section{The library metaphor- CI and branching pattern}
In a large project it is preferable to have one CM manager and responsible configuration controllers for each sub part eg. hardware, software, library. The controlled area is the area
where the CI of a project are stored. The CI library can have soft copies and hard (physical) copies.There should be a straightforward strategy for submitting soft and hard copies.
\subsection{What needs controlling and what can be left out}
A CI is any part of the development and deliverable which need to be individually and independently identified, stored, tested, reviewed, used changed, delivered or maintained. There can be different 
granularity of CI elements/items, they should offer added value as they introduce added complexity. One CI is independent of all other CIS.
If the component is included in: Would our ability to deliver the right system on time and within budget be impacted in any way if the element was lost/corrupted/wrong version? 
A CM should work towards fulfilling complete traceability. Should be notion of: version, access control, master, copy, relationships.
The main problems with CM: too much too soon(restricting development) or too little too late(Hard to regain traceability). The two tier model divides the configuration control into two levels:
the formal configuration level(total CM)(RELEASED,BASELINED etc) and the development configuration control(version handling)(DRAFTS). Both applied at the beginning but controls differ during development time... 
Create a CI plan that controls naming conventions etc. 
\subsection{Branching patterns for parallel SW development}
SCM structures can be explained as patterns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item organizational patterns - define how the organization is structured.
    \item architectural patterns - describe the software structure at a high level
    \item process defining patterns - describe structures, such as the project directory hierarchy which are defined at the beginning of a project.
    \item maintaining patterns - patterns that affect the day to day workings of the organization
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Parallel development - branching}
Many of the parallel development problems can be traced back to system evolution, scale, multiple dimensions, knowledge distribution.
There are different forms of branching - physical(files, components, subsystems), functional(features, logical changes), enviromental(win/nix), organizational(activities, tasks, roles, groups), procedural(teams work behaviours).
Codeline branch - persistent branch(environmental), activity branch, non persistent(to be merged).
Safety - nothing bad happens to the project . Codeline consistency(buildable codeline), reliability(eg. immutability of master branch baseline),
integrity and stability, lost changes(simultaneous update, shared data), appearing bugs(double maintenance).
Liveness - increased work efficiency, increased coordination efforts, contention and work stoppages due to "busy waits".
Reusability - reproducibility - reproduce contents of change, traceability-find the contents of the change, separability-separate wanted from unwanted changes.
Branches have policy patterns, creational patterns and structuring patterns, these patterns are underlined by the early branching(more safety, less productivity) or deferred branching patterns(less safety more productivity).
Branching/merging styles decide risk management strategies for organizing and integrating work activities.
Core set of branching patterns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mainline
    \item Codeline policy
    \item Code Line ownership
    \item Merge early and often
    \item Parallel maintenance/development lines
    \item overlapping release lines
\end{itemize}

Advice about branching in projects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use meaningful branch names
    \item Prefer branching over freezing
    \item Integrate early and often
    \item Branch on incompatibilities
    \item Preserve integrity and Consistency
    \item Isolate change
\end{itemize}

Different patterns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Early branching - Branch early and often, branch per task, one codeline per release.
    \item Lazy/Late branching - Wait until work conflicts with codeline and then branch, wait until logical change that is not needed/wanted in original codeline is implemented.
    \item Branch per task - Fork of a new branch for each activity that affects the codeline, merge in when tested and complete.
    when different development teams are engaged in large and complex changes that may involve conflicting changes to the same configuration items,
    it may be desirable to isolate them from each other using different development paths.
    This means they are each able to check-interim versions of their code without adversely affecting each other (as might occur if they were both using the same "mainline").
    Merging back to the trunk, or mainline, is deferred until each change is complete and the merge is "batched", meaning that all the related code changes are merged at the same time
    so that the mainline remains consistent.
    The main difficulty with using this pattern is that the amount of code to be merged is much larger than with "Branch per Release";
    this is because each merge involves the entire code for some new feature,
    rather than just a bug fix where the code changes are often quite small.
    \item Code Line per release - one branch per release to organize efforts focused on individual release, can use early or deferred branching.
    The optimum point at which to diverge a release configuration from the ongoing"mainline" of development would be at the point of "feature freeze",
    when the decision is taken not to include any more features in the release being planned.
    From this point onward it becomes important that no further feature-enhancement code leaks into the release and that only changes necessary
    to fix existing features are applied to that configuration.
    A criticism sometimes levelled at this pattern is that fixes need to be made in more than one place:
    any fixes made on a release branch are likely also to be needed on the trunk (mainline), and possibly on other release branches if multiple releases are active.
    This is true but is mitigated by the following factors:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The fixes which need to be merged will generally be relatively small code changes and therefore easy to merge
        \item The (generally much larger) feature changes do not need to be merged at all
        \item In practice, some of the fixes will have been rendered obsolete by other changes on the trunk and will not be required.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Subproject line - Using branch per task and need to perform large task that can be split into several subtasks. Create branch for large task and branch on it for smaller tasks.
    \item Parallel maintenance/development line - Create a maintenance and development branch of the mainline, propagate changes to codeline.
    \item Staged integration line - promotion line for different levels of code stability, when reach last level merge into the mainline.
\end{itemize}

\section{Identification and control}
Configuration control is the control of changes to the product and its documentation, the \textit{form, fit and function}. 
Need to pay special attention to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item change request documentation
    \item change request processing
    \item total impact analysis
    \item the decision
    \item results incorporation and documentation
    \item verification of the incorporation
\end{itemize}

There are different types of cm plans - project-to-customer, project-to-producer, neighbor to neighbor. The CM plan should be approved by a higher authority to ensure it fits into the context that
it is operating in. 
A CM plan normally consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Introduction
    \item Organization - responsibilities and authorities of various levels. Who - can do? is responsible? signs off? approves?
    \item Identification - details of Identification, how the system will work, how things are done, naming,numbers identification etc.
    \item Control - types of changes, classes of changes and priority processes and forms to be used.
    \item Accounting - describe the system, the reports and the process.
    \item Audits/Reviews - types, procedures and forms to be used and the verification interfaces. CM participation in program reviews.
    \item Interface control - communication between modules of the product, the production or operation.
    \item Subcontractors/Vendors - what CAN we expect from subcontractors/vendors.
    \item CM Resources
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{CM organization and change process}
CM placement is hard, too high --> ivory tower effect. Too low -> diminished impact.High enough for visibility, low enough for impact. Can be split eg. corporate/program level.
Four components of CM -> Identification, control, status accounting, audits should be taken care of.
Change in CM goes through three hierarchical levels: originator(recognition and analysis) ->  configuration manager(review of proposal and distribution)
-> CCB(impact assessment and decision, documentation) -> developer(implementation, verification).
\subsubsection{CCB board} A permanently established committee of representatives of the major organizational elements. Has authority to act on proposed changes at its level.
Primary mission = ensure complete impact assessment and analysis and establishment of baselines.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Meeting notice with agenda
    \item minutes of meeting - with disposition
    \item CCB Directive - the authorization of implementation. Contractual - should contain: Date, signature, implementer, change description, signoff on implementation, verification(Checked by CM or QA)
\end{itemize}
The change process allows for traceability and auditability. CCB is needed at every level of control, has authority to approve, defer, pass on change request.
\subsubsection{Interface control- the ICB}
Is used to Orchestrate an infrastructure to say \textit{who} is responsible for \textit{what}. It is connected with coordination and exchange of data.
The ICB is like the CCB but only for the detailed technical interfaces in the impact assessment process.

\subsection{Configuration Identification - traceability}
... is the process of recording and communicating information about the requirements, the design or the actual product. Units are broken down a top-down fashion.
Define the form-fit-function of the product. Requires developing effective naming conventions and good written procedures for CI, these need constant evaluation to ensure their completeness,
adequacy and applicability. A CI is an item which we want to focus on in the CM process. A CI is created in the process of decomposition, a top down process of dividing a product into related and subordinated parts.
Too many CIs will affect visibility and will constrict the production process while too little will create maintenance difficulties. In the hierarchy of naming where a component can be liked 
to its parents there are insignificant numbers and significant numbers, want as many significant numbers as possible.
Baselines - baselines assures anyone that the product is what it was intended to be, both in form, fit and function. Baseline assures us that the product is defined by documents.
A baseline is a point of departure for changes or product progression and also is a reference and control point for repeatability and reproducibility. There are different baselines for eg:
Specification, detailed specification, architecture, implementation, testing, shipping, maintenance...

\subsection{The CM managers identification responsibility}
CI manager is an advisor in the process of CI selection, naming standards  and decomposition, responsible for producing the listing for this decomposition. The CM manager has the control
function for the baseline management. The main task of the CM is to create a medium to trace the requirements to the final product, this medium is then the responsibility of the cm manager.

\subsection{ Configuration status accounting}
Provides traceability and status information within the configuration management process. Provides for communications and feedback on the product. Documents interfaces, ICD and CCB activities.
By using CSA we can see where we are and what we have built - places everything together to get the whole picture. It is the way in which products or the output of configuration control, identification and audits
are recorded stored and reported.
\subsection{Audits and reviews}
Configuration audits - verify that the technical documentation matches and reflects the product performance.
Formal audits are a configuration management verification activity. CI compared with its configuration documentation.
Audits provide an arena for interfaces with other program disciplines eg QA, verification and validation.
Functional audit and a form and fit audit(FCA- "functional configuration audit", PCA - "physical configuration audit").
In an audit we need, checklist, target, chairperson, recorder. Can result in action items(problem resolutions) that are completed.

\subsection{Impact analysis}
Is about accurately estimating the scope of changes. Dependency analysis and traceability analysis. Static and dynamic analysis is like lexical analysis.
Ripple effects - the unwanted side effects of change as eg. interface change, environmental change, requirement change etc.
Steps - understand software change and determine impact --> Specify and design software change -> implement software change.
Can create dependency graphs or matrixes. Can be data-flow, definition, calling or functional dependencies.
Transitive closure shows all paths from u to v. Inferencing systems use rules to characterise relationships among components.

\section{CM and PDM}
Product data management is the discipline of designing and controlling the evolution of a product design. SCM is the discipline of controlling the evolution of a SW product design.
Configuration Management transitions conventional document management systems to an
enterprise information management environment that captures, stores, manages, and retrieves
data but also identifies and retains the context of data and its relationship to projects, products,
assets, processes, equipment, organizations, and users throughout the complete life cycles of any
product within the organization. It ensures data integrity through closed-loop change management and
controls changes in a logical sequenceâ€”from inception to change-effects analysis to notification
to implementation and, finally, reporting by effectivity (dated baselines). This is an excellent
performance metrics reporting method, a perfect disaster recovery method and a means to
capture corporate knowledge before it leaves. \\
SCM is about controlling the evolution of complex SW, it does this by identification of components and documents, product structuring, control of continuous changes,
status accounting and auditing. SCm contains both product configuration and the working mode.
The most important aspects of SCM are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Version control - Storing/retrieving/comparing different versions of SW.
    \item Configurations/Selections - Create/select different associated versions of different items.
    \item Concurrency control - for concurrent development
    \item Build - keeping generated files  up to date, incremental builds.
    \item Release management - maintaining release packages and keeping track of builds 
    \item Workspace management - Controlling the working versions for the modules being changed.
    \item Change management - Supporting infrastructure for change requests.
\end{itemize}
SCM does not do a good job of handling complex items and does not recognize the semantics of the object.
\subsection{Differences between SCM and PDM}
PDM is focused more on the design side and less on the productions/maintenance.
In the product model SCM  is weak at data modeling while PDM uses tree structures. PDM supports historical, logical and domain versioning - generating different views of product structures.
When integrating SCM and PDM it is natural to communicate with the user through PDM as it covers a larger part of the total product lifecycle. Change and development management can be kept under PDM.

\section{Agile and SCM}
\subsection{Agile philosophies}
Agile methodologies are focused on quality and lean-ness through concepts like test-driven design (TDD), refactoring,continuous integration, close customer collaboration, pair programming, etc. 
Key sections in agile are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
\item working software over comprehensive documentation
\item Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
\item Responding to change over following a plan
\end{itemize}
Agile SCM is more about accepting and embracing change than preventing or controlling it.
Agile SCM requires high discipline, short-term effective feedback. An Agile SCM solution is one aimed at helping developers make accurate code changes to the appropriate set of code while collecting data on changes as they happen. \\
One of the paradoxes of agile development practices such as continuous integration and test-driven development is that if implemented correctly, they can actually enable a well-disciplined and almost self-governing approach for SCM. For example, test driven development requires that on every code change, agile developers must first write a unit test, then write sufficient code just to make the test work, and then subsequently refactor as necessary to complete the change. The code change is committed (or checked in), and its unit tests become part of the integration suite. Any side-effects of the change are made immediately visible through the integration build mechanism compiling and executing the unit test suite -- any problems that are found can then be fixed immediately. Such an approach will generally lead to better quality code being committed to the SCM repository.
\subsection{Documentation}
Documentation is created in order to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Consistently share knowledge across many people in a scaleable way, writing is not effective but is scalable.
\item Provide a persistent media from which to collaboratively build knowledge.
\item Make knowledge persist over time: There exists knowledge that is somewhat stable and offers value in a persistent form.
\end{itemize}
Agile says that we should delay decisions as late as possible and decide as "low" as possible. Write as few documents as possible as late as possible, when required.
Use documents that are central to project as code generation models, stories. Is about choosing the appropriate level of traceability for the project.
Rigorous traceability isn't always necessary for the typical agile project, except for the conformance auditing, which many agile methodologies accomplish via TDD, use lightweight specification protocols as tests and requirements - keep related artefacts close so they will be used.
\subsection{Configuratoin identification/Reports}
Creating CI reports, managing dependencies between them and keeping them up to date with the actual code from an agile perspective, today that happens during the build process. Build time is when we can capture the actual CI's for that release, know the dependencies between them and can relate them to the actual code with confidence that they won't change for that release.
\end{subsection}
Agile software configuration management is an approach requiring significant discipline from participants.  It's very focused on building quality into the software and in releasing more software in a shorter period of time. 
Different projects have different tolerances for risk, which will dictate the amount of knowledge traceability required.

\Section{Agile SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item Versions. Agile projects implement refactoring, that is they implement the simplest solution possible first and refactor code to redesign the solution as and when necessary. This means that code versions are continually updated in the SCM repository and refactoring operations such as add, delete, move and rename need to be well supported by the SCM tool and the tools into which SCM integrates.
\item Branches. Agile projects implement simple branching strategies, typically an Active Development Line and maybe a Release Prep Line. The Active Development Line is used by developers to commit their changes and is the means by which continuous integration builds are carried out. The Release Prep Line is used to stabilize or engineer a release before making it available to customers; developers are typically not allowed to commit changes to it.
\item Workspaces. Developers typically have a single private workspace initially pointing at the collective set of latest versions of the Active Development Line. Their workspaces are updated at a minimum when they start work on a new feature or change request and just before they commit their changes to the Active Development Line to check for integration issues.
\item Labels. As with traditional SCM, labels (or baselines) are placed at significant milestones on a collective set of code versions, at a minimum on every release build, so that it is possible to reproduce a build environment if necessary.
\item Builds and integration. An automated build process is a key factor of successful agile development. The build process typically monitors the Active Development Line for commits and, if found, automatically executes (after a grace period) an integration build and unit test. Notification of the success or failure of this build is a key communication factor in agile teams.
\item Change control. There is an implicit authorization process with agile development teams â€“ at least at the implementation level. Developers are authorized to make changes based on customer priority or refactoring as necessary. Requests are recorded either in change control systems, or even for more informal projects (particularly within eXtreme Programming projects) on cards or flip charts.
\item Deployment. Agile projects deploy testable applications frequently, particularly where application server environments are in use (e.g. J2EE/Microsoft.NET application servers). Therefore the deployment of frequent incremental baselines or change requests needs to be supported by the SCM tool, as well as the ability to report and query on the versions of the application in each of the environments.
